# ucsdGPT

This is a chatbot based on courses at the University of California, San Diego.

I built this project with LangChain, Supabase, and Next.js.

## V1

Initially, I copy-and-pasted all UCSD undergraduate courses into a text file. Then, using LangChain and Supabase, I created vector embeddings (arrays that capture the semantic meaning of text) for all 3,898 courses.

Once the data was in place, I created a basic chatbot script using Langchain. This script considered context from relevant course descriptions and the original question from the user.

Using Next.js, I turned this script into a server action. This action runs whenever a user submits the chatbot form.

This was a fun project, and I'm excited to see what else I can build with these tools.

## V2

The initial version was used 2100+ times. Mostly well received, but I did get criticism in a UCSD discord server.

Most feedback was related to usabilityâ€”outside of course info, V1 wasn't that useful.

This time around, I've added more embeddings data (primarily focused on gen ed requirements for UCSD's 8 colleges). I also added relevant schedule information.

V2 also uses GPT-4o mini (as opposed to 3.5) and a newer embeddings model from OpenAI.

V2 is designed to be more user-friendly, especially on phones (V1 admittedly wasn't great in this regard).

I've also added authentication. Not a pain point for users, but I don't want people to burn through my OpenAI credits.
